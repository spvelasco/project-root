<h1>Analogy on the use of AI in Dev Work</h1>
<p>You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders.</p>

<p>Simply, no. I already consulted with my wife (girlfriend) and we would rather find a documentation team that asks for less but has better equipment, portfolio, and work experience. Kidding aside, I would first check the quality of their work through their portfolio. If they present quality that is worth the price they are asking for, then I am willing to take their offer even with the equipment they are using. However, it makes me doubt that if they earn around 40k for every project and given the quality they produce, would they not have invested in better equipment already? On another note, I personally find it hard to trust the documentation team. If they only use pre-set templates from CapCut to edit the videos, then it is like asking ChatGPT to edit the videos and turn them into edits worth 40k. I must say, their integrity and honesty is commendable in letting me know what equipment they will use and price they are asking for, but I am already set on finding a better, well-equipped and experienced videographer/photographer since it is my wedding after all—an event I do not want to take chances in. </p>
