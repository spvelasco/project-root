# project-root
Repository for our class pre-finals in CSDC100. It is for making a website which is outside of my forte, but I'll try cooking. 

What I need to add here:
1. Project title - Paopao's Generative AI Website

2. Short overview - My website is pretty straightforward. It consists of 4 pages (One for Home, FAQ, Ethical AI use, and Analogy) each containing its own informations. 

3. Instructions on how to run the project - Copy deployed project link and paste on browser. I think it should work as intended once step(s) are followed.
   
5. Frameworks/libraries used - I tried using bootstrap but I decided against it. I used notepad++ on my potato laptop and honestly its been so difficult even producing lines of codes since my version do not have presets (For some reason, it also does not allow me to paste things??? I'm not sure po what is wrong with my notepad++ but I have to mention I am running it on windows 8.1). For designs and stuffs like that, I mostly watched Youtube videos especially with how accordions worked and here are the links for some:

Note: Sir please if you have any suggestions on waht applications I can use just like vscode for creating html stuff, it would be great help since most of what I found needed to be downloaded / requires latest windows...

6. Screenshot of your website (I will add it on the repository, I do not know how to add images here in the README.md directly)
