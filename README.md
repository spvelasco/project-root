# project-root
Repository for our class pre-finals in CSDC100. It is for making a website which is outside of my forte, but I'll try cooking. 

What I need to add here:
1. Project title - Paopao's Generative AI Website

2. Short overview - My website is pretty straightforward. It consists of 4 pages (One for Home, FAQ, Ethical AI use, and Analogy) each containing its own informations. 

3. Instructions on how to run the project - Copy deployed project link and paste on browser. I think it should work as intended once step(s) are followed.
   
5. Frameworks/libraries used - I tried using bootstrap but I decided against it. I mostly watched Youtube videos especially with how accordions worked and here are the links for some:

6. Screenshot of your website (I will add it on the repository, I do not know how to add images here in the README.md directly)
